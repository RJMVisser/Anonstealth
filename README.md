## Anonsurf
Anonsurf is a tool that will help you stay anonymous by routing every packet through TOR relay.


## Pandora
Pandora overwrites the RAM, clears the entire system cache and recudes the memory reclaim thresholds.


# Installation
This package comes with an installer that makes things extremely easy:
```
sudo bash ./installer { --install or -i | --remove or -r }
```
Once the installer is complete, you will be able to use both the anonsurf and pandora modules.
